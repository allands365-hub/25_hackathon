# Sponsor Signin Fix - October 26, 2025

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** After signing in as a sponsor, the page did not redirect to the sponsor dashboard

**Root Cause:** Missing redirect logic in `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### File: `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `useRouter` import
2. Added `router` instantiation
3. Added redirect logic after successful sign in

**Code:**
```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'; // Added

export default function SignInPage() {
  const router = useRouter(); // Added
  
  // ... existing code ...
  
  const handleSponsorSignIn = async () => {
    // ... existing signin logic ...
    
    if (error) {
      toast.error(error.message);
      console.error('Sponsor sign in error:', error);
    } else {
      toast.success('Signed in successfully!');
      router.push('/sponsor'); // Added this line
    }
  };
}
```
