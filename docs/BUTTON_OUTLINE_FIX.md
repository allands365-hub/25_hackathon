# Button Outline Fix - October 26, 2025

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Buttons throughout the application were missing visible outlines/borders, making them less prominent and harder to identify.

**Affected Buttons:**
- "Create Challenge" button on sponsor dashboard
- Sign Out button
- All buttons using the default variant

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied

**File:** `components/ui/button.tsx`

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed `outline-none`** from base button styles
   - This was preventing any visible outline from showing

2. **Added borders to all button variants:**
   - **Default variant:** `border border-primary/20`
   - **Destructive variant:** `border border-destructive/30`
   - **Outline variant:** `border-2 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700`
   - **Secondary variant:** `border border-secondary/20`

3. **Enhanced outline variant:**
   - Made border thicker (`border-2`)
   - Better contrast with `border-zinc-300` for light mode
   - Added hover states for better interactivity
