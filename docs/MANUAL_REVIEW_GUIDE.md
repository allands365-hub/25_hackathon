# 🎯 Manual Review System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Manual Review System enables sponsors to manually evaluate submissions using custom rubric criteria, generating hybrid scores that combine AI evaluation (50%) with human judgment (50%).

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Manual Score Form**

## 📊 Understanding Scores

### **Score Types**

| Badge | Meaning | Calculation |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 🟣 **Hybrid** | Both AI and Manual reviews exist | `(AI × 0.5) + (Manual × 0.5)` |
| 🔵 **AI** | Only AI evaluation available | AI score as-is |
| 🟢 **Manual** | Only Manual review available | Manual score as-is |

### **Weighted Criterion Scoring**

Example rubric:
- Technical Implementation (30%)
- User Experience (25%)
- Innovation (20%)
- Production Readiness (15%)
- Problem Solving (10%)

If you score:
- Technical: 85 → Contributes 25.5 points (85 × 0.30)
- UX: 90 → Contributes 22.5 points (90 × 0.25)
- Innovation: 75 → Contributes 15 points (75 × 0.20)
- Production: 80 → Contributes 12 points (80 × 0.15)
- Problem Solving: 70 → Contributes 7 points (70 × 0.10)

**Final Manual Score**: 82/100

If AI scored this submission 78:
**Hybrid Score**: `(78 × 0.5) + (82 × 0.5) = 80`

  CASE
    WHEN e.score IS NOT NULL AND mr.score IS NOT NULL
      THEN ROUND((e.score * 0.5) + (mr.score * 0.5))
    WHEN mr.score IS NOT NULL THEN mr.score
    WHEN e.score IS NOT NULL THEN e.score
    ELSE NULL
  END AS final_score

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Hybrid score not showing**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Database view not created
2. Manual review not committed
3. No AI evaluation exists

**Solution:**
- Run migration 002 to create views
- Check `manual_reviews` table has entry
- Ensure `evaluations` table has entry for submission

### **Issue: Leaderboard not updating in real-time**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Supabase Realtime not enabled
2. Channel subscription failed

**Solution:**
- Check Supabase project settings → Realtime enabled
- Check browser console for subscription errors
- Verify RLS policies allow reading evaluations/manual_reviews

### **Issue: "You can only review submissions to your own challenges"**

**Cause:** Trying to review a submission for a challenge you didn't create.

**Solution:**
- Verify you're the challenge creator
- Check `challenges.created_by` matches your user ID
