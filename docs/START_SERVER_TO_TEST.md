# Start Development Server to Test Tailwind v4

## Current Status:
✅ Configuration updated for Tailwind v4
✅ Packages installed
⏳ Waiting for server to start

## Next Steps:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wait for the server to start** - You should see:
   ```
   ✓ Ready in X.Xs
   ○ Compiled / ...
   ```

3. **Once the server is running**, navigate to:
   - http://localhost:3000

4. **I'll then check the UI for any Tailwind v4 errors**

## What to Look For:
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ UI renders correctly
- ✅ No Tailwind compilation errors
- ✅ Styles apply correctly

## Expected Tailwind v4 Behavior:
- Using `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
- PostCSS using `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- All styles should work as before
