# UI Fixes Applied - October 26, 2025

**Status:** âœ… All Fixes Applied

---

## ðŸ”§ Issue Found

The UI enhancements broke the application due to:
- CSS `@apply` directive in Tailwind v4 (not supported in all contexts)
- Invalid color syntax in custom classes

---

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed CSS Color Syntax (`app/globals.css`)

**Problem:** Used `@apply` directive which caused build errors

**Before (Broken):**
```css
.score-high {
  @apply text-green-600 dark:text-green-400;
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```css
.score-high {
  color: #16a34a; /* green-600 */
}

.dark .score-high {
  color: #4ade80; /* green-400 */
}
```

**Applied to:**
- `.score-high`
- `.score-medium`
- `.score-low`
