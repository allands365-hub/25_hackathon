# Navigation Authentication Fix

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

After signing out, users couldn't see the sign-in button, and profile/dashboard buttons were still visible. The navigation was not properly checking authentication state.

## Issues Identified

1. **After sign out:**
   - "Get Started" button not showing
   - Profile/Dashboard links still visible
   - Should show public navigation only

2. **Not signed in:**
   - Should only show: Challenges, Leaderboard, About
   - Should show "Get Started" button
   - Should NOT show profile-specific links

## Solution

Updated `components/Navigation.tsx` to properly handle authentication state:

### Before:
```tsx
// Always showed role-based navigation regardless of auth status
{isSponsor ? (
  // Sponsor links
) : (
  // Builder links
)}
```

### After:
```tsx
// Check authentication first
{!isAuthenticated ? (
  // Public navigation (Challenges, Leaderboard)
) : isSponsor ? (
  // Authenticated sponsor navigation
) : (
  // Authenticated builder navigation (includes "My Profile")
)}
```

## Navigation States

### 1. Not Signed In (Public)
- ✅ Challenges
- ✅ Leaderboard
- ✅ About
- ✅ "Get Started" button

### 2. Signed In as Builder
- ✅ Challenges
- ✅ Leaderboard
- ✅ My Profile
- ✅ About
- ✅ User avatar + name
- ✅ Sign Out button

### 3. Signed In as Sponsor
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ My Challenges
- ✅ View Arena
- ✅ About
- ✅ User avatar + name
- ✅ Sign Out button

## Changes Made

**File:** `components/Navigation.tsx`

- Added authentication check before showing role-based navigation
- Public users see minimal navigation (Challenges, Leaderboard)
- Authenticated users see full navigation based on role
- Sign out button properly appears/disappears based on auth status
