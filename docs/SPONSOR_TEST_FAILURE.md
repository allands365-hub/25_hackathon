# Sponsor Test Failure - October 26, 2025

## 🔍 Issue

**Error:** Profile creation failed after sponsor signup with RLS policy violation (code 42501)

**Test Details:**
- Email: `sponsor@techcorp.com`
- Company: TechCorp Solutions
- Result: Account created but profile creation failed

**Error Message:**
```
Profile creation error: {code: 42501, details: null, hint: null, message: new row violates row-level security policy...}
```

---

## ❓ What This Means

The Supabase Auth user was created successfully, but when trying to insert the user profile into the `users` table, the Row Level Security (RLS) policy blocked the insertion.

**Possible Causes:**
1. RLS is enabled on `users` table
2. No policy allows new users to insert their own profile
3. The `users` table requires additional columns that weren't set during creation

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

For sponsor signup with email/password:
1. ✅ Create Supabase Auth account
2. ✅ Verify email (if enabled)
3. ✅ Insert user record into `users` table with:
   - Same ID as auth user
   - Role: 'sponsor'
   - Company details
4. ✅ Redirect to `/onboarding` for company profile completion

---

## 🔧 Investigation Needed

We need to check:
1. **RLS Policies on users table**
   - Look at `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Check if there's an "INSERT" policy for users
   
2. **Signup Flow**
   - Review `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
   - Check if it's using the correct Supabase client
   - Verify the user insertion logic

3. **Database State**
   - Check if all migrations have been run
   - Verify users table structure

---

## 🧪 Test Results

### What Worked:
- ✅ Signup form validation
- ✅ Supabase Auth account creation
- ✅ Button outlines visible
- ✅ UI displays correctly

### What Failed:
- ❌ User profile creation in `users` table
- ❌ Automatic redirect to onboarding
- ❌ Full signup flow

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Check RLS policies** on users table
2. **Review signup implementation** in `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
3. **Verify migrations** have been applied
4. **Add or modify RLS policy** to allow new user inserts

---

## ⚠️ Note for User

The signup partially works but fails at the profile creation step due to database security policies. This needs to be fixed before we can test the full sponsor flow.

**Recommendation:** Check Supabase dashboard for RLS policies on the `users` table and either:
- Add a policy that allows authenticated users to insert their own profile
- Or use service role key for user creation during signup
