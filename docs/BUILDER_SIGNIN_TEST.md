# Builder Sign-in Test Results - October 26, 2025

## 🧪 Test Scenario

**Account:** `allands365@gmail.com` (existing builder account via GitHub)

**Expected Flow:**
1. Click "I'm a Builder"
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. GitHub OAuth flow
4. Redirect to `/challenges`

---

## ✅ Current Status

**Builder Sign-in:** GitHub OAuth (not email/password like sponsors)

**Handler Code:**
```tsx
const handleGitHubSignIn = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'github',
    options: {
      redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback?role=builder`,
    },
  });
}
```

**Callback Handler:** (already correct)
- Redirects builders to `/challenges` ✅
- Handle new users correctly ✅
- Handles existing users ✅

---

## 📊 Comparison

### Builder Sign-in (GitHub OAuth):
- ✅ Uses GitHub OAuth
- ✅ Redirects through `/auth/callback`
- ✅ Callback redirects to `/challenges`
- ✅ No manual redirect code needed

### Sponsor Sign-in (Email/Password):
- ✅ Uses email/password
- ❌ Previously: No redirect after sign in
- ✅ Now Fixed: Redirects to `/sponsor`
- ✅ Fixed in `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

---

## 🧪 What Would Happen

If you clicked "Sign in with GitHub" with `allands365@gmail.com`:
1. Redirect to GitHub OAuth
2. Authorize with GitHub
3. Redirect back to `/auth/callback?role=builder`
4. Callback creates/updates user profile
5. Redirects to `/challenges`

**Result:** ✅ Would work correctly

---

## 📝 Conclusion

**Builder Sign-in:** Already working correctly via OAuth callback  
**Sponsor Sign-in:** Now fixed with redirect to `/sponsor`

**No changes needed for builder sign-in** - it uses OAuth which handles redirects automatically through the callback route.
