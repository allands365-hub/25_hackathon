# üö® Missing: Traefik Reverse Proxy

## The Problem

Your `buildai-mainapp-ianblz` container is running but **Traefik** is not running!

Looking at your `docker ps` output:
```
buildai-mainapp-ianblz.1...  Up 6 minutes  3000/tcp
```

Notice:
- ‚úÖ Container is running
- ‚ùå No external port mapping (no `0.0.0.0:80->3000/tcp`)
- ‚ùå Traefik is NOT in the running containers

---

## What's Missing

Dokploy uses **Traefik** as a reverse proxy to:
1. Listen on ports 80/443
2. Route traffic to your containers
3. Handle SSL certificates
4. Provide domain management

**Traefik is NOT running!**

---

## üîß Solution: Configure Dokploy Properly

### Step 1: Check Dokploy Configuration

Your app needs to be configured in the Dokploy dashboard, not just running as a container.

Go to: **http://69.62.82.25:3000** (Dokploy dashboard)

### Step 2: Check Application Settings

1. Navigate to: **Build-AI ‚Üí production ‚Üí MainApp**
2. Check **"General"** tab
3. Look for **"Docker Network"** or **"Network Mode"**
4. Should be: `traefik` or `host` or similar

### Step 3: Add Domain

1. Go to **"Domains"** tab
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter: `classly.space`
4. Choose **"Generate certificate"**
5. Click **"Save"**

This will:
- Start Traefik automatically
- Configure SSL certificate
- Route traffic to your app

---

## Quick Check: Is Traefik Supposed to Be Running?

Dokploy might work differently than expected. Let's check:

```bash
# Check if Dokploy has Traefik management
sudo systemctl status dokploy

# Check Dokploy configuration
sudo docker exec dokploy.1.mfewtutxl09fyz2x2o615a898 env | grep TRAEFIK

# Or check for reverse proxy
sudo docker network ls
```

---

## Alternative: Manual Traefik Setup

If Traefik should be running but isn't, we need to deploy it:

### Option 1: Let Dokploy Handle It

The issue might be that your app isn't deployed through Dokploy's proper workflow.

In Dokploy dashboard:
1. Go to **MainApp**
2. Click **"Deploy"** button
3. This should auto-configure everything including Traefik

### Option 2: Check if App Needs to Be Redeployed

```bash
# Check current deployment
# The app might need to be redeployed to get Traefik routing

# In Dokploy dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments tab
# 2. Look for "Configure Domain" or "SSL" options
# 3. These options usually trigger Traefik setup
```

---

## What You Should See in `docker ps`

After proper configuration:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

Should show something like:

```
traefik              "traefik..."             Up   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp
buildai-mainapp...   "node..."                Up   3000/tcp
```

---

## Immediate Action Plan

### 1. Go to Dokploy Dashboard

Visit: **http://69.62.82.25:3000**

### 2. Navigate to Your App

- Project: **Build-AI**
- Environment: **production**
- Application: **MainApp**

### 3. Go to Domains Tab

Look for **"Domains"** or **"SSL"** tab

### 4. Add Domain

- Domain: `classly.space`
- Enable SSL: YES
- Click **"Save"** or **"Generate Certificate"**

### 5. This Will Trigger

- Traefik container to start
- SSL certificate generation
- Routing configuration

---

## Expected Result

After adding the domain in Dokploy, you should see:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

Output should include:
```
traefik-container   ...    Up   ...   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp
buildai-mainapp...  ...    Up   ...   3000/tcp
```

---

## Test After Configuration

```bash
# Test HTTP
curl -I http://classly.space

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://classly.space

# Should return 200 OK or redirect
```

---

## If Domain Configuration Doesn't Work

### Fallback: Direct Port Access

You can temporarily test if the app works:

```bash
# Test directly via port 3000 (if mapped)
curl http://69.62.82.25:3000

# But this won't work because container isn't mapped to host
```

### Better: Configure Properly in Dokploy

The only real solution is to properly configure the domain in Dokploy dashboard, which will trigger Traefik to start and handle the routing.

---

## Summary

‚úÖ Your firewall is now correct (ports 80/443 open)
‚úÖ Your app container is running
‚ùå Traefik (reverse proxy) is NOT running
‚úÖ DNS is correct

**Solution:** Configure the domain `classly.space` in Dokploy dashboard to trigger Traefik setup.
