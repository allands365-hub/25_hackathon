## Test Results

All screenshots were captured and verified using Playwright browser automation. The computed background color for `document.body` was checked using:

```javascript
getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor
```

Result for all pages: `"rgb(255, 255, 255)"` (white)

## Changes Applied

1. Removed all `dark:` Tailwind classes from `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`
2. Replaced `bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-black` with `bg-white`
3. Removed `dark:text-zinc-100`, `dark:text-zinc-400`, etc. from all text elements
4. Set all backgrounds to solid `bg-white`

## Console Errors Noted

Several 404 errors for missing resources were observed across all pages:
- Multiple "Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)" messages
- These appear to be for missing icon/favicon resources
- Not CSS-related issues

## Recommendations

1. ✅ All critical pages now have proper white backgrounds
2. ⚠️ Consider fixing 404 errors for missing resources (icons/favicons)
3. ✅ The application is ready for light-mode deployment

## Files Modified

- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Removed all dark mode classes
- `app/globals.css` - Has `!important` rules for light mode
- `app/layout.tsx` - Has inline styles and forced theme
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Dark mode disabled

## Conclusion

The CSS audit is **COMPLETE** and **PASSED**. All pages are displaying with proper white backgrounds in light mode. No dark mode styling issues remain.
