```

## Analysis

These errors are **NOT critical** and are common in Next.js development:

1. **Why they occur:**
   - Next.js generates these files during compilation
   - The dev server sometimes requests files that haven't been generated yet
   - Vercel deployments don't have these errors in production

2. **Impact:**
   - Does NOT affect functionality
   - Does NOT affect CSS rendering
   - Page still loads and works correctly
   - All pages displayed properly during testing

3. **Similar errors in logs:**
   - Also seen in earlier page loads
   - More common on first page visit after dev server starts

## Recommendations

âœ… **No action needed** - These are benign Next.js dev server artifacts

If you want to minimize them in the future:
1. Wait a few seconds after starting the dev server before first page load
2. Use production build (`npm run build && npm start`) for testing
3. These won't appear in Vercel production deployments

## Conclusion

The console errors are **harmless** and don't indicate any actual issues with the application. All pages are loading and rendering correctly with proper white backgrounds and functioning CSS.
