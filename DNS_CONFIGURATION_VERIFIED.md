# ✅ DNS Configuration Verified for classly.space

## Your Current DNS Records

### ✅ Correct Records for Dokploy Deployment:

1. **A Record (Root Domain)**
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: `@`
   - Content: `69.62.82.25`
   - ✅ This points classly.space directly to your VPS

2. **CNAME (WWW Subdomain)**
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `www`
   - Content: `classly.space`
   - ✅ This ensures www.classly.space works too

3. **A Record (Demo Subdomain)**
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: `demo`
   - Content: `69.62.82.25`
   - ✅ Points demo.classly.space to your VPS

4. **CAA Records (SSL Certificate Authorization)**
   - ✅ Let's Encrypt is explicitly allowed
   - ✅ Other major CAs also permitted
   - ✅ This enables Dokploy's automatic SSL generation

---

## Everything is Correct! ✅

Your DNS is perfectly configured for:
- ✅ classly.space → 69.62.82.25
- ✅ www.classly.space → classly.space → 69.62.82.25
- ✅ demo.classly.space → 69.62.82.25
- ✅ SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt is authorized)

## Next Steps

### 1. Open Ports 80 & 443 (CRITICAL! 🚨)

Since you confirmed ports 80 and 443 are closed, open them NOW:

```bash
ssh root@69.62.82.25

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload

sudo ufw status
```

### 2. Configure Domain in Dokploy

1. Go to: http://69.62.82.25:3000
2. Navigate to: **Build-AI → production → MainApp**
3. Click **"Domains"**
4. Add: `classly.space`
5. Dokploy will automatically generate SSL certificate

### 3. Wait for SSL Generation

- Usually takes 1-2 minutes
- Check logs in Dokploy dashboard

### 4. Access Your Site

Once SSL is ready:
- 🌐 http://classly.space → redirects to HTTPS
- 🔒 https://classly.space → Your Next.js app
- 🔒 https://www.classly.space → Your Next.js app

## Verify DNS Propagation

Check if DNS has propagated:

```bash
# From your local machine
nslookup classly.space

# Should return: 69.62.82.25
```

Or use online tools:
- https://dnschecker.org/
- Enter: `classly.space`
- Look for global DNS propagation

## Testing Checklist

After opening ports:

- [ ] SSH into VPS
- [ ] Open ports 80 and 443
- [ ] Restart Dokploy
- [ ] Configure domain in Dokploy
- [ ] Wait for SSL certificate generation
- [ ] Test: `curl -I https://classly.space`
- [ ] Test: `curl -I http://classly.space`
- [ ] Visit in browser: https://classly.space

## Expected Result

Once ports are open and domain is configured:

✅ **SSL Certificate**: Auto-generated by Dokploy via Let's Encrypt
✅ **HTTPS**: https://classly.space works
✅ **HTTP Redirect**: http://classly.space → https://classly.space
✅ **WWW Redirect**: www.classly.space → classly.space → HTTPS
